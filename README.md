# TellMe - A platform for sharing stories

TellMe is a modern and lightweight platform for sharing stories about your travels, work, and ideas. It's a place where you can connect with other people, share your experiences, and get inspired.

The backend is a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) instance, a leading open-source headless CMS, and the frontend is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern and performant static site generator. The combination of these two technologies allows for a flexible, powerful, and easy-to-use platform.

## ✨ Features

- **Share your stories:** Write and publish your stories with a simple and intuitive editor.
- **Connect with others:** Read and comment on stories from other users.
- **Discover new ideas:** Get inspired by stories about travel, work, and creativity.
- **Lightweight and performant:** The frontend is a static site, which means it's fast, secure, and easy to deploy.
- **Easy to customize:** The backend is a Strapi instance, which means you can easily customize the data structure and add new features.
